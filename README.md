# Cogni

This is an experimental interpreter for the [Cognate](https://github.com/cognate-lang/cognate) programming language that parses and runs the code directly and doesn't have to compile to C first.

In its present state it is not operable by any means. If you are looking for an embedded scripting language interpreter that actually works, look somehere else.
